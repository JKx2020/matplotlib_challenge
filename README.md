# matplotlib_challenge

In this project I do statistical analysis and create visualizations on a dataset about 250 different mice in a recent animal study about tumor growth rate. 

Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy and SciPy.stats, I do the following analysis:

* Generated the below plots:
  1. bar plot
  2. pie plot
  3. line plot
  4. scatter plot
  5. box and whisker plot
  
* Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen
* Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens
* Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume
* Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot
